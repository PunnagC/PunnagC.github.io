<div align="left"><b>Abstract:</b><br>
  This letter investigates the energy harvesting capabilities of a novel hybrid wind and solar transduction device. 
  The proposed device is an inverted-U shaped structure with a pair of piezoelectric benders connected by a flexible, 
  tensioned photovoltaic ribbon. The tensioned photovoltaic ribbon member undergoes aeroelastic flutter limit cycle 
  oscillations (LCOs) at low wind speeds, leading to time-varying tension forces applied to the piezoelectric benders, 
  producing cyclic deflections and output voltage. Experimental characterization of the proof of concept energy harvester 
  indicates that it is possible to obtain several milliwatts (mW) of power using the centimeter scale device, with an 
  output power of ~12.1 mW at a combination of 12 m s−1 wind speed and 100 W m−2 of solar irradiance, for indirect solar 
  applications. It is shown here that an optimal combination of applied tensile preload and preset angle of attack exists 
  which produces the highest wind power output of the system. An explanation of this behavior is also provided through the 
  analysis of data collected on the photovoltaic ribbon velocity, piezoelectric voltage signals, and high-speed imagery, 
  providing further insight to the motion kinematics of the highly nonlinear system response. Interestingly, the solar power 
  output has been observed to remain invariant with increasing vibration velocity. This suggests that the gain in solar power 
  efficiency from vibration-induced convective cooling negates any losses from the deflected incidence angle of the photovoltaic 
  ribbon. These results illustrate that there is a negligible performance penalty in adding wind energy harvesting capability 
  to the solar cells with this device concept.</div>

  compliant flexure flow energy harvester</a></h4></div>
<div align="left"><b>Abstract:</b><br>
  This paper presents the concept of a flow-induced vibration energy harvester based on a one-piece compliant flexure structure. 
  This energy harvester utilizes the aeroelastic flutter phenomenon to convert flow energy to structural vibrational energy and 
  to electrical power output through piezoelectric transducers. This flexure creates a discontinuity in the structural stiffness 
  and geometry that can be used to tailor the mode shapes and natural frequencies of the device to the desired operating flow regime 
  while eliminating the need for discrete hinges that are subject to fouling and friction. An approximate representation of the 
  flexure rigidity is developed from the flexure link geometry, and a model of the complete discontinuous structure and integrated 
  flexure is formulated based on the transfer matrix method. The natural frequencies and mode shapes predicted by the model are 
  validated using finite element simulations and are shown to be in close agreement. A proof-of-concept energy harvester incorporating 
  the proposed flexure design has been fabricated and investigated in wind tunnel testing. The aeroelastic modal convergence, critical 
  flutter wind speed, power output and limit cycle behavior of this device is experimentally determined and discussed.</div>

<div align="left"><b>Abstract:</b><br>
 This paper extends the classical single-turbine actuator disc theory by Betz [1], and the dual-turbine actuator disc theory by 
 Newman [2], which describe the maximum power extraction capabilities of a single and dual horizontal axis turbine, respectively, 
 to a system of co-axial actuator discs operating in yaw conditions (ie, for the case where the free stream velocity is not normal 
 to the turbine plane). The study takes advantage of dividing the flow into independent streamtubes, and analyzing them separately 
 as they pass through momentum discs while simultaneously affecting each other. Similar work has been done recently by Rosenberg 
 et al.[3] with a smaller diameter rotor upstream of a main rotor with cutout and the flux-line theory for cycloturbines by Adams and 
 Chen [4].</div>

<div align="left"><b>Abstract:</b><br>
  Researchers have performed theoretical investigations of flow induced limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) of tensioned ribbons. 
  Furthermore, attempts have been made to tap into the energy harvesting capability of such ribbons, owing to its structural simplicity, 
  low weight and ease of fabrication. However, in order to tune the ribbon to perform optimally at a given location, a robust, 
  reliable model of the ribbon is essential to predict the limit cycle behavior. The model needs validation across a broad spectrum 
  of its operating envelope based on experimentally obtained results. This paper seeks to provide experimental data for a sample 
  tensioned ribbon in cross flow to serve as basis for validation of an aeroelastic model. This paper experimentally characterizes 
  a PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) ribbon of aspect ratio 18 across a range of applied axial preload tension and wind speeds.</div>

<div align="left"><b>Abstract:</b><br>
  A multifunctional compliant structure is proposed that can harvest electrical power from both incident sunlight and ambient mechanical 
  energy including wind flow or vibration. The proposed energy harvesting device consists of a slender, ribbon-like, flexible thin film 
  solar cell that is laminated with piezoelectric patches at either ends and mounted in the cross flow of wind in a clamped-clamped end 
  condition with an adjustable axial preload. Taking this motivation forward a system model of the energy harvester is developed which 
  captures the structural response of the solar ribbon and couples it with Theodorsen unsteady aerodynamics to predict the flutter 
  boundary conditions as a function of applied axial preload tension. The model also accounts for geometric and material discontinuities, 
  by effective use of Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) modeling technique both in bending and torsional degrees of freedom. This paper also 
  derives TMM technique for torsional vibrations with an applied axial load from first principles, verifies the method and presents its 
  applicability for the proposed energy harvester. The paper also points out that the flutter instability arises out of different 
  structural modes at different values applied axial tension, with the help of a sample modal convergence plot. The analysis also 
  presents the possibility to tune the solar ribbon to operate at an optimal reduced frequency by adjusting the applied axial preload.</div>

 This paper proposes a multifunctional compliant structure that can harvest electrical power from both incident sunlight and ambient 
  mechanical energy including wind flow or vibration. The energy harvesting device consists of a slender, ribbon-like, flexible thin 
  film solar cell that is laminated with piezoelectric patches. The harvester is mounted in longitudinal tension and subjected to a 
  transverse wind flow to excite flow-induced aeroelastic vibrations. This paper formulates an analytic model of the bending dynamics 
  of the device. We present a Transfer Matrix formulation that also accounts for the changes in natural frequencies and mode shapes of 
  the system when subjected to axial loads in a beam. It also observed that mode shape obtained using TMM formulation shows numerical 
  stability even for very high tensile loads providing results consistent with the geometric boundary conditions applied at the ends 
  of a beam. This article also discusses about structurally modeling a piezo - solar energy harvester using TMM methodology, where a 
  thin clampedclamped solar film is bonded with piezo patches having a much higher bending stiffness. Additionally, the effect of axial 
  tension on the mode shape of the thin host structure of the piezo-solar ribbon is presented and it is shown how this tension can be 
  used advantageously to affect the strain distribution of the entire structure and introduce higher strains at the piezo patches.</div>
