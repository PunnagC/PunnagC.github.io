  <p>Abstract:<br>
  This letter investigates the energy harvesting capabilities of a novel hybrid wind and solar transduction device. 
  The proposed device is an inverted-U shaped structure with a pair of piezoelectric benders connected by a flexible, 
  tensioned photovoltaic ribbon. The tensioned photovoltaic ribbon member undergoes aeroelastic flutter limit cycle 
  oscillations (LCOs) at low wind speeds, leading to time-varying tension forces applied to the piezoelectric benders, 
  producing cyclic deflections and output voltage. Experimental characterization of the proof of concept energy harvester 
  indicates that it is possible to obtain several milliwatts (mW) of power using the centimeter scale device, with an 
  output power of ~12.1 mW at a combination of 12 m s−1 wind speed and 100 W m−2 of solar irradiance, for indirect solar 
  applications. It is shown here that an optimal combination of applied tensile preload and preset angle of attack exists 
  which produces the highest wind power output of the system. An explanation of this behavior is also provided through the 
  analysis of data collected on the photovoltaic ribbon velocity, piezoelectric voltage signals, and high-speed imagery, 
  providing further insight to the motion kinematics of the highly nonlinear system response. Interestingly, the solar power 
  output has been observed to remain invariant with increasing vibration velocity. This suggests that the gain in solar power 
  efficiency from vibration-induced convective cooling negates any losses from the deflected incidence angle of the photovoltaic 
  ribbon. These results illustrate that there is a negligible performance penalty in adding wind energy harvesting capability 
  to the solar cells with this device concept.</p>
