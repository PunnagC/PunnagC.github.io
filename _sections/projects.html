<div align="left">
 A flexure hinge serves as a connection or a joint between two structural elements. The flexure hinge could provide an alternative to a
rotary bearing, especially in applications where full rotary motions (i.e. complete 360-degree rotations) are not required. Rolling or 
sliding surfaces are prone to fouling and require periodic maintenance (lubrication). Using a flexure hinge removes the maintenance 
requirement and reduces the number of assembled parts. 
<br>
  Additionally, using a flexure hinge segment could provide additional tuning capability within a structure. A flexure segment causes an 
abrupt change in the bending rigidity of the structure that will in turn be reflected in the mode shapes and natural frequencies of the 
complete structure. At the same time, this segment could be designed to maintain enough stiffness against deformation in other directions 
such as in-plane bending and out-of-plane torsion to prevent undesired vibrations. 
<br>
  One such usage of the flexure hinge is demonstrated below, in an aeroelastic energy harvesting device. To create an abrupt change in 
the out-of-plane bending rigidity of the structure, a series of patterned cuts are integrated into the substrate, creating a compliant 
flexure segment and dividing the structure into a ‘beam segment’ upstream and a ‘flap segment’ downstream. Compared to previous modal 
convergence flutter energy harvesters, which used a discrete pin or ball-bearing hinge assembly between a beam.
