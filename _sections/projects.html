<div align="left">

 A flexure hinge serves as a connection or a joint between two structural elements. The flexure hinge could provide an alternative to a
rotary bearing, especially in applications where full rotary motions (i.e. complete 360-degree rotations) are not required. Rolling or 
sliding surfaces are prone to fouling and require periodic maintenance (lubrication). Using a flexure hinge removes the maintenance 
requirement and reduces the number of assembled parts. 
<br>
  Additionally, using a flexure hinge segment could provide additional tuning capability within a structure. A flexure segment causes an 
abrupt change in the bending rigidity of the structure that will in turn be reflected in the mode shapes and natural frequencies of the 
complete structure. At the same time, this segment could be designed to maintain enough stiffness against deformation in other directions 
such as in-plane bending and out-of-plane torsion to prevent undesired vibrations. 
<br>  
  One such usage of the flexure hinge is demonstrated below, in an aeroelastic energy harvesting device. To create an abrupt change in 
the out-of-plane bending rigidity of the structure, a series of patterned cuts are integrated into the substrate, creating a compliant 
flexure segment and dividing the structure into a ‘beam segment’ upstream and a ‘flap segment’ downstream. Compared to previous modal 
convergence flutter energy harvesters, which used a discrete pin or ball-bearing hinge assembly between a beam.

  In order to derive the effective bending rigidity, the patterned flexure segment of length \(l_h\) is discretized into \(n_h\) rigid 
links each having an elemental length of \(l_r\). Each of these elemental links is connected to the preceding link with a rotational 
spring of stiffness \(k_\theta\) (where, \(k_\theta = 2GJ⁄l_e\) ). Figure above shows this arrangement of links and rotational springs 
cantilevered from a wall and bending due to a load \(P\) applied to the tip of rigid element \(n_h\). Under these conditions, the tip 
deflection of the discretized structure undergoing bending is given by
<br>
\[ δ_{n_h} = \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{n_h} l_r \sin⁡(\displaystyle\sum_{p=1}^{j} \theta_p) \] 
<br>
  Balancing the moment acting across the tip and root of the \(i^{th}\) rigid element gives us the torsional rotation of the \(i^{th}\) 
spring as
<br>  
 \[ \theta_i = \frac{P(l_n - x_i)}{k_\theta}\] 
<br>  
  Assuming small angles and neglecting the effect of geometric foreshortening under large deflections, the effective linear tip 
stiffness of the discretized structure is given by \(K_l\). This can be further equated to the linear tip stiffness of an equivalent 
beam of length xx and with the same cantilevered boundary conditions
<br>
\[ K_l = \frac{P}{δ_{n_h}} = \frac{3 \overline {EI_e} } { {l_h}^3} = \frac{6 {k_\theta} } { l_r(n_h + 1) - l_r(n_h - 1)n_h(n_h + 1) } \]
<br>
  Thus, the effective bending rigidity of the flexure segment, \(\overline {EI_e}\) can now be written as
<br>

<br>
  This equation is useful as it relates the geometric properties of the flexure hinge to that of the bending rigidity of this segment, 
facilitating the tuning of the flexure segment to affect the desired natural frequencies of the entire structure.
