A flexure hinge serves as a connection or a joint between two structural elements. The flexure hinge could provide an alternative to a rotary bearing, especially in applications where full rotary motions (i.e. complete 360-degree rotations) are not required. Rolling or sliding surfaces are prone to fouling and require periodic maintenance (lubrication). Using a flexure hinge removes the maintenance requirement and reduces the number of assembled parts. 

Additionally, using a flexure hinge segment could provide additional tuning capability within a structure. A flexure segment causes an abrupt change in the bending rigidity of the structure that will in turn be reflected in the mode shapes and natural frequencies of the complete structure. At the same time, this segment could be designed to maintain enough stiffness against deformation in other directions such as in-plane bending and out-of-plane torsion to prevent undesired vibrations. 

One such usage of the flexure hinge is demonstrated below, in an aeroelastic energy harvesting device. To create an abrupt change in the out-of-plane bending rigidity of the structure, a series of patterned cuts are integrated into the substrate, creating a compliant flexure segment and dividing the structure into a ‘beam segment’ upstream and a ‘flap segment’ downstream. Compared to previous modal convergence flutter energy harvesters, which used a discrete pin or ball-bearing hinge assembly between a beam.

In order to derive the effective bending rigidity, the patterned flexure segment of length l_h is discretized into n_h rigid links each having an elemental length of l_r. Each of these elemental links is connected to the preceding link with a rotational spring of stiffness k_θ(where, k_θ=2GJ⁄l_e ). Figure above shows this arrangement of links and rotational springs cantilevered from a wall and bending due to a load P applied to the tip of rigid element n_h. Under these conditions, the tip deflection of the discretized structure undergoing bending is given by
                                δ_(n_h )=∑_(j=1)^(n_h)▒〖l_r sin⁡(∑_(p=1)^j▒θ_p 〗)
